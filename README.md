# Hello! I'm Safwan
I'm a full stack software engineer. I specialize in building things that drive me crazy. 

Thanks to my cushy (i wish) role at IKEA as a software engineer, I can pay my bills.

When I'm not pulling out my hair due to work related stuff, I'm pulling it because of things I do in my free time:
- open source contributions when I feel useful
- side projects that are not and will never be good enough to "mark as done ‚úÖ"
- working on [Kommentar](https://github.com/kommentar), a free and open-soure commenting system
- writing random stuff on my site @ [safwanyp.com](https://safwanyp.com)

That last one is not so much of a reason to pull my hair out, but ya know, gotta be dramatic.

Thank you for reading! Here's an emoji of slice of a cake for the journey that lies ahead üç∞
